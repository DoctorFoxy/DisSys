You can use ./run-rest-service to start the server.
It starts in the background! Even when disconnecting the VM the server stays on!
Make sure you don't run multiple instances of the service at once!

All the console output of the server is being written into the .log file.

Use htop (sort by mem usage) to see if the server process is running
If it is you can kill it through htop
